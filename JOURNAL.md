<p>I want to try and limit how much material is between the heaters, and the tube, so I'm using a quite thin wall. I did ask people in the #cad channel what they thought of this but at time of writing I didn't get a reply</p>

<p>Heatsink fans on one side, now just to mirror them.</p>

<p>Very nice! We now have a hole for the pcr tube to go in, a hole for the thermistor, slots for the heaters and heatsinks to cool down easier. I'm not sure how well this'll be cnced as I've never ordered a cnc part before but hopefully nothing breaks.</p>
