<p>I want to try and limit how much material is between the heaters, and the tube, so I'm using a quite thin wall. I did ask people in the #cad channel what they thought of this but at time of writing I didn't get a reply</p>

<p>Heatsink fans on one side, now just to mirror them.</p>

<p>Very nice! We now have a hole for the PCR tube to go in, a hole for the thermistor, slots for the heaters and heatsinks to cool down easier. I'm not sure how well this'll be CNCed as I've never ordered a CNC part before but hopefully nothing breaks.</p>

## Still May 24th

<p> Spent a ton of time researching and compiling parts. While not very technical, it's time that's very much needed. I also now know the specs of everything, so I can start writing code to control it all!</p>

>Started designing a wiring circuit

<p>First time ever using a pcb designer, but I'm slowly making process on the wiring schematic. I'm making it on easy-ada designer and since it technically isn't really a pcb alot of the parts I need aren't there.</p>
<p>This could maybe be a pcb? It'd be kinda small but it'd made wiring everything slightly easier? Something for me to think about.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to take a screenshot, website froze up and erased my progress. -__- I can't prove it either which sucks. Ah well, an hour wasted. Time for lunch.</p>
