# Single-PCR
A cheap, easy to use single tube PCR thermocycler for biotech.
For Hack Club's Highway event!

<p>I aim for Single-PCR to be a cheap easy PCR alternative for hobbyists. It'll be controlled by an ESP-32 board broadcasting a control website. From the control website you can adjust cycles, monitor temperature data, abort reactions etc.<p/>
