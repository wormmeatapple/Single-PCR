# Single-PCR
A cheap, easy to use single tube PCR thermocycler for biotech.
For Hack Club's Highway event!

<p>Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR for short) is a vital reaction used in all sorts of biology fields. It amplifies a predetermined segment of dna, doubling it every cycle! PCR has three steps; 1. Get quite hot (95c) to split apart dna 2. Cool back down to allow little marker pieces of rna to anneal to the big, now detached dna 3. Heat back up to allow little protein machines to create more dna! This repeats 20-40 times until you have BILLIONS of copies of a specific piece of dna. This cycling is often done in very expensive, university level PCR thermocyclers that use peltier modules to heat and cool dynamically. My design does the same heating and cooling by using much cheaper components, resistive heaters and cpu fans. (Back in the day they used heated water baths!). I aim for Single-PCR to be a cheap easy PCR alternative for hobbyists. It'll be controlled by an ESP-8266 board broadcasting a control website. From the control website you can adjust cycles, monitor temperature data, abort reactions etc. Creating this vital piece of hardware would allow me to preform tons of different biohacking protocols, and if I can make it cheap enough, maybe it'll let others do the same!<p/>
